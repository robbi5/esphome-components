Custom external components for esphome

## uart_readline

Based on [Custom UART Text Sensor](https://esphome.io/cookbook/lambda_magic.html#custom-uart-text-sensor), but migrated to an external component, because [Custom Components are deprecated](https://esphome.io/guides/contributing#a-note-about-custom-components) and will be removed from ESPHome in the 2025.1.0 release.
